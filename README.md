# CDN files for Projects

This repository will serve as a CDN for CSS and JS to be used in my upcoming projects. The problem I am trying to resolve is:
- The CSS, JS are not my thing and I use them freely available versions on the internet.
- These files are large and I can't include them directly in my projects because I can't explain their working properly.
- That's why thee files will be hosted here to be used in projects.
 
### Why not using other services?
I don't like their working plus GitHub is my favorite

### Why it needs to be a GitHub page?
In the past, the hosting services provided these files with proper content headers but some misused this service for crypto mining. So if the hosted files are directly called, they are served as plain/text files. 

To resolve this, I need to publish them as GitHub pages which allows them to be served with the right content headers.
